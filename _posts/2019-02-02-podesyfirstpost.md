## POcket DEsign SYstem Applied to Tabletop Games 

This blog is notes and design diary for the projects created with PoDeSy. 

The goals of the system are:
* Always available, android phone as master device. 
* Capture ideas in written and voice memos. 
* Recall ideas with tagging and search.
* Quick prototyping, digital and physical. 
* Playtesting, tracking and sharing progress. 
* Archiving and revisiting projects. 

## Sirens on the Jagged Rocks

It's easy to get lost in tweaking a system instead of producing playable prototypes. Success will be measured by output. System apps and methods will be culled for speed. 

## Initial Tools and Methods 

* Android apps
   * SimpleTask
   * Epsilon notes
   * Forker
   * DrawExpress
   * PrinterOn
   * Voice Recorder
   * Otter
* Platforms 
   * Bitbucket for versioning/archiving
   * Github for Jekyll blog and image hosting
* Physical Methods 
   * 3 ring binder for early prototypes
   * 9 card sheet protectors for modular boards
   * Dry erase for game state tracking 
   * Mini cards printed 18 per sheet and mini card sleeves 
   
## Let's Get Sailing 

As my projects progress I will go into detail on the methods used and results attained. I hope this blog is helpful for you or at least serves as a cautionary tale.
